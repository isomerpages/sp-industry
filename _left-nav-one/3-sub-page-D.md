1. PUBLIC LIABILITY

   Please note that SP has taken out S$5,000,000.00 public liability policy (the “Policy”) to generally cover (amongst other items) loss or damage to property and/or injury or illnesses which arise in the course of the Internship Program. In the event that the company (the “Company”) suffers such losses or damage in the course of providing SP’s students with training under the Internship Program, and strictly to the extent such losses or damage are covered by and are recoverable by SP under the Policy, SP will reimburse the Company the amount of such losses or damage from the proceeds of the Policy.

   For the avoidance of doubt, the Policy covers firms, organisations or establishments offering practical training, sporting facilities or field work studies to SP’s students in respect of (a) loss or damage to property belonging to the Company or other third parties, (b) injury to or illness of persons other than the students and (c) injury to or illness of the students or loss or damage to the property of the students. In connection with the above, property damage covered by the Policy shall mean physical damage to the substance of tangible property and shall not include damage to data or software.
