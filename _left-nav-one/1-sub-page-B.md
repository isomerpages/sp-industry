The primary objective of internship is to expose students to meaningful and relevant workplace attachment to better connect their learning to the workplace and deepen their skills, so that they are better prepared for their transition to the workplace after graduation.

The duration of SP internship ranges from 6 to 42 weeks. The following list shows the different internship programs, respective duration, and Senior Liaison Officers.

For internship commencing **March-April 2019**, the application is now **open**. Please click here to apply for internship.

The data collected in the application form is limited to what is necessary to facilitate the carrying out of internship programme by SP. As SP offers other training and collaboration opportunities that benefit our industry partners, companies that collaborate with SP on internship may also receive information on these programmes from time to time.

Availability of students for internship depends on the demand from companies. Some of our internship programs that are well-subscribed may not have available vacancy much before the commencement of the internship and we seek your understanding on this, companies can apply as early as 5 months before the start of internship.
