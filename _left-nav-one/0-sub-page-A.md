#### ROLE OF COMPANY
1. Singapore Polytechnic (SP) looks forward to collaborating with companies in providing internship opportunities to our students.

2. Internship aims to let students learn through meaningful work assignments and industry exposure to deepen and apply both technical and soft skills, and help them make better career choices.

3. To maximise our student’s contribution to your company and optimise the business value of an internship programme, we encourage you to:
  * Have a clearly defined work-plan that aligns with your company’s goals and the learning objectives
  * Supervise and mentor the student effectively for a positive outcome

4. SP will assign a Liaison Officer as the main coordinator between SP and the company during the internship duration. The Liaison Officer will visit the student’s work site a number of times, depending on the internship duration, to check on his progress as well as to gather feedback from the Company Supervisor on the student’s performance or progress. Should there be any issue of misconduct, emergency, accident or need for clarifications, the Company Supervisor is advised to contact the Liaison Officer as the first point of escalation.

5. Besides confidentiality and non‐disclosure agreement, the student is not obligated to sign any contract, indemnity form, or  legal documents. For further clarifications, please contact the Liaison Officer.

6. Unless otherwise agreed in writing with SP, no intellectual property rights belonging to SP should be used by the students or the company during the internship.

7. Since the Internship Program’s primary purpose is to fulfill academic course requirements and not to form an employer‐employee relationship between our students and the company, the Employment Act would not normally apply. Nevertheless, it should be noted that SP is a statutory board and treats employment issues and working conditions very seriously. SP would therefore expect companies to provide working conditions for its students similar to the minimum standards prescribed for employees generally and the terms set out in this guidelines have been drafted accordingly to reflect such standards.

#### SUPERVISION AND MENTORING
1. Please note that it is the Company’s responsibility to supervise our student’s work during the internship to ensure that the quality/standard of work meets the requirements for the Company. In the event that our student makes any suggestions or proposals during the internship, it is solely the Company’s responsibility to decide whether such suggestions or proposals are suitable/appropriate for implementation by the Company and the Company shall not hold the student or SP liable in respect thereof.

   To maximise our student’s contribution to your company and optimise the business value of an internship programme, we request a participating company to manage the student by providing:

   A **Company Supervisor**, whose role is to:
      * Plan and discuss the internship requirements with the SP Liaison Officer
      * Brief student on company policies, functions and operations, rules and regulations, and safety and security matters
      * Discuss and guide the student to meet the requirements and learning objectives
      * Meet and discuss with the SP Liaison Officer on the student’s progress
      * Provide feedback and assess the student’s performance

   A **Company Mentor**, whose role is to:
      * Enrich the student’s learning experience by giving an overview of the company’s structure, nature of business and work requirements
      * Broaden student’s perspective of job prospects and career paths within the industry
      * Motivate the student by sharing his/her work experiences and career journey in the industry

2. Overview on Mentoring
   SkillsFuture is a national movement to enable all Singaporeans to develop to their fullest potential, as well as realise their aspirations by taking advantage of a wide range of opportunities. As part of SkillsFuture, the polytechnics will be working with companies to enhance their internship programmes with the implementation of mentoring.

   Mentoring during internship is a developmental relationship in which an experienced industry practitioner (mentor) provides career guidance to a student while the student is on internship.

   Through the mentoring relationship, student is expected to be better aware of the career opportunities and requirements in the industry.

3. Requirements of Mentor

   It is recommended that a mentor:
      * Be an experienced staff from the company who possess good knowledge of career pathways within the company and in the industry
      * Possess preferably 5 years or more relevant industry experience
      Based on the roles defined, it is the company’s discretion to decide on whether the Company Supervisor and Mentor to be the same individual or otherwise.

   To make it easy for the Company Supervisor and Mentor, there is a simple checklist under the Internship Journal Section A to guide them on the tasks to be carried out during the internship period. If in doubt, they may clarify with the SP Liaison Officer.

4. Requirements of Student

   Student must be fully aware that it is a privilege to have a mentor while on internship as industry professionals are spending their time mentoring them.

   Student should:
        * Initiate and maintain contact with their mentors to coordinate the meet ups
        * Be encouraged to reflect on what he or she hopes to accomplish at internship and beyond, as well as the pathways to get there, using the Student Reflection section in the Internship Journal.
