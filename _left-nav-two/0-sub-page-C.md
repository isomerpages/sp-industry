#### Co-location @ Singapore Polytechnic

Singapore Polytechnic (SP) has been engaging industry for more than 60 years. With more than 150,000 strong alumni, 900+ academic staff, PhD researchers, Technology Innovation Centres, Consultancy Centres and 15 000+ students across many disciplines, we are committed to have a value exchange with industry partners for mutual benefits. Strategically located at Dover, SP provide excellent connectivity to the Jurong Innovation District, Trade Association Hub, Biopolis, NUS, Launch Pad and many others.

SP can provide high quality students for internships at the facility with clear outcomes such as developing solutions, proof of concepts or assisting in a market survey or study. SP students have done well in joint projects with industry partners and they are highly sought after.

SP cordially invites industry partners to co-locate in our campus to augment real world learning for our learners. As one of our Collective Aspiration to advance the human potential, we strive for closer and strategic collaboration between academia and industry in curriculum design, delivery, teaching, learning, training, research and in other areas as well. We believe the value exchange through such partnerships will be mutually beneficial to both SP and the industry.

If you are keen to explore a co-location partnership, please contact our colleagues from the Department of Industry & Partnerships at enterprise@sp.edu.sg. We would love to meet you and explore opportunities together.
